# Troubleshooting
This section provides known issues description.

## Game session: Delayed round
In some cases, transactions on the **Balance Flow** tab can be highlighted with different colors. For example, unexpected balance changes or very big balance changes are highlighted with red.

To investigate the case, copy the **Bet ID** value and then filter the **ID** column using this value. In the details of this transaction, you can check the reason why the balance has been changed.

In our example, we can see the player made a bet three months ago from the current date and closed a game uncompleted. Considering that such actions are prohibited on brand websites according to the Terms and Conditions, we are allowed to deduct the amount if it is credited to the balance and all the respective winnings that occur from such activity.

## Duplicated transactions
As a transaction process usually takes time and can’t be performed immediately, the following image shows an example of duplicated transactions.

## Big wins
Sometimes big wins happen. In case you monitor the player’s balance and realize it is a big win, we recommend you to reach out to a game provider. The game provider approves or declines the transaction.

## Opposite betting pattern
It usually happens with Live games, when the player places bets on both outcomes of events and receives back the bet amount as a winning on their personal or duplicated account.
Such actions may occur between multiple players, one losing against another on purpose.
