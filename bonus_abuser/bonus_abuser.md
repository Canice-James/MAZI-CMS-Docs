2. Go to **Dashboard** > **Account Status**. 
3. Select the **Bonus abusing** or **Bonus suspicious** checkbox.

As a result, the corresponding message "Marked as Bonus Abuser" will appear in the **Comments** > **Messages** section.

## Bonus abusing patterns
Bonus abuse refers to the practice of exploiting promotional offers, typically designed for new users, by signing up multiple times or using unethical strategies to gain unfair advantages. This practice, also known as **promo abuse**, **bonus hunting**, **bonus whoring**, or **multi-accounting**, often targets **no deposit bonuses** like free spins or free cash.

General strategy of bonus abusing: A player places high bets while using a bonus on a high-volatility slot. After achieving a significant win, they shift to a low-volatility game and make smaller bets. This minimizes their exposure to losses while retaining the bonus winnings.

**Indicators to watch for:**
* Sudden changes in game preferences (from high- to low-volatility games). 
* Noticeable adjustment in bet sizes after a big win.

### Live cashback offers
Players exploit live cashback promotions by playing exclusively when the offer is active, often placing maximum bets (e.g., €200 on blackjack).

* Winning Scenario: If they win the hand, they double their money.  
* Losing Scenario: If they lose, they recover 25% of their bet via cashback. Given the low house edge in blackjack (~2% or 98% RTP), they aim to secure long-term profit with minimal risk.

Since live casino games often contribute only 10% towards bonus wagering requirements, unlike slots, which contribute 100%, so miscalculations in contribution rates can be exploited.
If you notice live casino games contributing more than the stated percentage, we recommend to inform your managers immediately.

### Casino gamification abuse
Players exploit loyalty programs by earning loyalty coins/points through low-risk or no-risk wagering. These coins are then exchanged for bonuses, providing unfair advantages.

**Indicators to watch for:**
* Multiple rounds where the exact or very close bet amount is returned to the player. 
* Frequent usage of coin purchase bonuses in the **Bonus** tab.

### Sports gamification abuse
Players exploit sports loyalty programs by accumulating points through turnover in the casino or sports sections and exchanging them for unlimited free bets. This can result in cases where the player’s bonuses are equal to or exceed their deposits, creating an unbalanced play dynamic.

> Note that marking the account as a bonus abuser (BA) does not prevent them from exchanging points for free bets.

**Indicators to watch for:**
* Frequent free bet claims without limitation.
* Bonus amounts are consistently equal to or greater than deposits.

### High odds chasing
Players use bonus money to place bets on high odds (e.g., draw outcomes, underdog wins, or last-minute bets) to maximize profit with minimal actual risk.

**Indicators to watch for:**
* Bets placed on odds of **1.8** or higher. 
* Immediate withdrawal after winning bets (optional but common). 
* Preference for single bets.

### Late betting
Players place bets after the cutoff time, exploiting information that could include match outcomes, often due to system glitches, operator errors, or having access to faster data feeds.

Indicators to watch for:
* Large bet amounts.
* Accumulator Bets: Two or three matches where:
  * One match has odds of **2.0+** (late bet). 
  * Other matches have very low odds (**1.01**–**1.10**). 
* Occasional single bets, though less common. 
* Immediate cash-out after winning the late bet. 
* Short settlement periods (bet and settlement occur within minutes).

Ways to prevent late betting abuse:
* Single Bet: A wager with only one selection (e.g., Team A to win vs. Team B).
* Accumulator Bet: A wager combining multiple selections, all of which must win to secure a payout.

### Cash-out
A common pattern, where the player:
* Deposits and places a bet for the entire deposit amount on sports. 
* Receives the First Deposit Bonus (FDB) for casino play. 
* Plays down the casino bonus, then cashes out the sports bet. 
* Wagers the deposit on an exploitable slot, then withdraws their funds.

### Free bet
A player exploits free bet offers designed with a wagering requirement of x3 on odds of **1.5** or higher for either single or multibets. The abuse involves:
* Winning with the free bet, after which the free bet amount is automatically deducted, leaving the winnings in the account. 
* Attempting to withdraw the winning amount without fulfilling the x3 wagering requirement.

**Indicators to watch for:**
* Free bet winnings are used without meeting wagering requirements. 
* Withdrawal attempts immediately after winning free bet funds. 
* Non-compliance with wagering on specified odds (**1.5** or greater).

> To prevent free bet abuse, any withdrawal attempts without meeting the wagering requirement should be flagged by the Risk Team, who cancels the withdrawal and informs the player.
